[Demo](https://prashnts.github.io/graph.project/)

Project Repository for fulfillment of course II.2 Discrete Mathematics at [Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi](https://ducic.ac.in). Generates a random Map, and finds the least cost path between two different regions.

##Implementations:
- Dijkstra Algorithm for Dictionary Graph in Python and JavaScript.
- Path Highlighting and Coloring.
- Path length finding.

Based on [Map Generator](https://github.com/stravid/mapgenerator).
